# See the world in my eyes

This is a really interesting topic for me, I hope you enjoy this to who ever is reading this.

I have a very great visual memory. I am not artistic myself, but I love to be inspired by people’s creations. I try to be unique as much as I can, But I Love every art aspect anyone ever does. **I am not an artist.**

### Colors

I feel colors. does that make sense? a while ago I had a dream about Moods and colors and it made me want to know more about feelings and colors, and it became interesting. I took some pictures of all the things I use Every day, from my laptop, to my desk, to almost everything I own, and I came up with this list using Figma, and used this tool to extract the colors  [image-picker](https://coolors.co/image-picker):

You’ll most likely see parts of them on my page **Hopefully,**   and I have a Huge interest in seeing how this goes since I am awful at choosing the right colors.

### Why I’m doing this

I believe that time is gold, so when ever I have a chance to do somethin I should do it, even if it was undone. to be honest, half way done (Perfectionist trait). I have been learning frameworks at the bootcamp I’m attending, and this is to make sure that I have to some extent great knowledge at it.

By the time you are seeing this, 17/04/2023, the framework I used is Django,  with it I will be using Bootstrap and animate.css, I will make sure to put what ever I use in the documentation of the project, I hope you enjoy this cause I’m sure I will!
