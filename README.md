### Motivation:
Out of a desire to experiment and pure curiosity, I am creating the same website, content-wise, in many frameworks as a learning experiment.

### Tools:
- [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/qwikcity/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1)
- [Qwikui](https://qwikui.com/) (if necessary)

### Credits:
- [@EmNudge](https://github.com/EmNudge) is one of the most inspirational humans I've ever seen; he's the main person behind this idea.
- [wileyqb](https://www.wileyqb.com/) inspired the theme of the website as well!

### Todo:

### Versions:
