  - Sign In and Sign Up Pages:
    On these pages, we have used Ajax to implement the non-refreshing page method for a better user experience. Once the user registers for the app, they are redirected to the main dashboard to let them know that their registration process went smoothly. Once they sign up, a random avatar is generated for them based on their first name. You can find out more about how to use this avatar here -->> [Random Avatar](https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/apis-to-generate-random-user-avatars/#multiavatar-api)..

  -  Logged In Profile Pages:
    When we go to our profile in the navigation bar or click on our name, we are redirected to our main profile. Here, we can see our posts, our friends, our requests, and we can post on our profiles, which will also be displayed on the main dashboard.
