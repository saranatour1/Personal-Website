# About Me

My name is  **Sara**, From Palestine.

## Background

I was born in Palestine and have had the opportunity to visit three countries throughout my life. Additionally, I hold a degree in electrical engineering, which I achieved at the end of June 2022.


 I made a significant decision to pursue a career shift because there were no opportunities that aligned with my interests. It seemed like a better solution to explore new possibilities and avenues. 

Making such a decision was challenging and involved months of research and contemplation. While adapting to the world of programming was not difficult, the real struggle came from the uncertainty of "What's Next?" This uncertainty caused me to reconsider everything and brought about a sense of heartache.

### Enrolling in a Bootcamp for Skill Enhancement

In pursuit of my career transition, I took the initiative to enroll in a bootcamp in February. The experience has been highly rewarding thus far, as the program focused on four key areas over the span of four months.

- **Web Fundamentals**: In this module, we explored the foundations of web development, delving into **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the building blocks of the modern web.

- **Python Stack**: The bootcamp provided a comprehensive understanding of Python programming language and its applications. We also learned **Flask** and **Django** frameworks, empowering us to develop robust web applications.

- **Java Stack**: This segment focused on **Java**, a powerful programming language widely used for various applications. Additionally, we delved into the **Spring Boot framework** to bolster our skills in developing enterprise-level applications.

- **MERN Stack**: In this part of the bootcamp, we ventured into the MERN stack, a versatile technology stack featuring **React** for frontend development, **MongoDB** for database management, **Express** for backend development, and **Node.js** for server-side scripting.

Throughout the bootcamp, we gained a wealth of knowledge in algorithms and problem-solving patterns, and we put our skills to the test by solving various LeetCode problems. Additionally, engaging in numerous projects allowed us to delve deeper into the subject matter, enriching our learning experience. 


During the bootcamp, we worked on several projects, enhancing our experience. We also had insightful tech-talks on best practices in our field. Now, I'm in the job application phase, hoping to find a company that will help me grow and succeed. Making it in this field is my goal, and that opportunity will mean everything.
