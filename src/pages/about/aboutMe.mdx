# About Me

My name is  **Sara**, From Palestine.

## Background

I was born in Palestine and have had the opportunity to visit three countries throughout my life. Additionally, I hold a degree in electrical engineering, which I achieved at the end of June 2022.


 I made a significant decision to pursue a career shift because there were no opportunities that aligned with my interests. It seemed like a better solution to explore new possibilities and avenues. 

Making such a decision was challenging and involved months of research and contemplation. While adapting to the world of programming was not difficult, the real struggle came from the uncertainty of "What's Next?" This uncertainty caused me to reconsider everything and brought about a sense of heartache.
